          <p>HP (or you can say Hypertext Preprocessor) is a veteran player in the web development world. This open-source server-side scripting language is created in 1994 and is specifically used for web development. As it is an interpreted language – it doesn’t require a compiler either and also it can run on almost every major operating system like Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix, etc. Talking about the enriching features of PHP, there are so many such as easy to learn nature, cross-platform compatibility, OOPs features, support to various standard databases like MySQL, SQLite, etc. huge community support, and many others. Other than that, PHP is very much secure as a server-side scripting language as there are numerous hash functions available in PHP for the encryption of user’s data. In particular, if you’re a beginner – you can opt to go with PHP for backend web development5.</p>

            <img src="Java.png" height="300" width="300">
            <p>Java is another exemplary programming language for backend web development. The object-oriented programming language is widely used for developing enterprise-scale web applications along with the development of android applications, desktop applications, scientific applications, etc. The primary advantage of using Java is that it works on the Write Once Run Anywhere principle i.e, the compiled Java code can be executed on any platform that supports Java without the need for recompilation. In more specific terms, the Java code is first compiled into byte code which is machine-independent and then this byte code runs on the JVM regardless of the underlying architecture. Besides, Java supports multithreading that allows the concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization of CPU. Other additional features of Java are – platform-independent, follows the OOP concepts, rich open-source libraries, automatic memory allocation & garbage collection, portability, etc.</p>
